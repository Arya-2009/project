            <p>Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.

                For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.
                
                Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems.The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).</p>
